## Why stack-based

## Why F♭ is interesting

### Hierarchical Write once, read many dictionary

### Immutability

All items on the stack or in the dictionary are immutable using [structural sharing](https://medium.com/@dtinth/immutable-js-persistent-data-structures-and-structural-sharing-6d163fbd73d2) at the object and array level.  This avoids unwanted side effects, makes object stores memory efficient, and enables easy back tracings.
