## White space

In F♭, spaces, tabs, newlines and commas (`,`) are all considered whitespace, and have no impact on code execution except as a separator between elements.  Brackets (`[](){}`) are always considered to have whitespace padding.  For example, the follow are considered eqivalent in F♭: `[1,2,3][4,5]` and `[ 1 2 3]  [4 5]`.
