# Function Definitions / Expanding Functions

TBD:

`def`
`bind`
`defer`
`;`

## Definition convention

* Subject-(Object-)Verb pattern
* Should be lower kebab-case
* Inquisitive words \(typically boolean returning functions\) should end with question mark \(`?`\)
  * `string?`, `zero?`, `prime?`
* Procedures should be verbs
  * `dup`, `dip`, `drop`
* Types should be nouns
  * `string`, `number`, `complex`
* By convention words begging with underscore `_` are considered private.
